# DataBase Replication

why we need database replications? well becuase:
...Keep data geographically close to client(reduce latency)
...To allow the system to continue working even if some of its parts have failed(and thus increase availablity)
...To scale out the number of machines that can serve read quieries(and thus increase read throughput)
